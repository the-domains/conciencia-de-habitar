## she believes I'm playing piano in a whore house...

I found this quote entering at the architect's office for which I was working in Denver. And in a millisecond I saw a time-lapse of what I've been feeling about the architectural profession since the last years of the career at college, even though I already was a builder since 1991\.

It was the clearest synthesis of a feeling I was trying to put in words for my thesis in a class named" Theory and critic of architecture". Of course the Professor in charge refuse to let me questioning the "Architect Role"

So I been keeping this bitter taste since then and this is what this blog it is about... serving real people.

Airports, malls, huge transportation hubs are OK, but what about the real life of real people every single "real" day of (real realities, not reality shows) those human been when returns home?

There is actually a big Lack of services in people needs and a big communication gap between users and Architects.

We Aim to become the biggest solutions providers of small needs to make life better, healthier, happier, greener and cheaper... Oops I shouldn't say the last one It's again our profits.

We believe in real solutions at the right price for anyone budget.
